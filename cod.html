                      <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;In distributed computing, <span id="def"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_on_demand">code on demand (COD)</a></span ></a> is any technology that sends executable software code from a server computer to a client computer upon request from the client's software. &rdquo;</p></blockquote> 
                        <p class="modal-p">The code will be in an inactive state and stay in the server(client) until it is requested by the user(client). Client-server style is the most common architecture in computer network, in which a centralized server responds to the requests coming from the clients. Clients can use their personal computers or any software devices while servers are just more powerful machines located on the network. The bridging gateway between the two is established by the browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and others.</p>
                        <p class="modal-p">CoD is considered a type of mobile code paradigm. Figure 1 illustrates that CoD is different from other types such as Client-Server, Remote Evaluation (REV) and Mobile Agent (MA) because it executes code locally, while the others execute the code remotely. Before and After fields represent where the resources and know-how will be before and after execution of the service. Location and resources are the deciding factors when developing a software by using one of the mobile paradigms. </p>

                        <p class="modal-p">REST (Representational State Transfer) is a widely used software architectural that aims at making reliable and stateless Web API, which turn improves web service’s non-functional requirements such as reliability, scalability, portability, and many others. For example, giant firms such as Amazon, Ebay and others scaled their business at scale by adopting REST. 
                        Web APIs that follow some or all guiding principles of REST are considered RESTful. These principles are client–server architecture, statelessness, cacheability, uniform interface, using layered system and supporting code on demand. While the first 5 principles listed are constraints of REST, code on demand is considered an optional constraint, because allowing executable code to be run locally may cause security issues.</p>

                              Figure 2. Illustrates the interaction between Louise and Christine. Louise would like to make a cake and has the resources 
                              such as oven and ingredients(resources), however she does not have a recipe that she can use. To solve this issue, 
                              she contacts Christine, gets the recipe(know-how) and prepares the cake locally at her home.</p>
                            <p class="modal-p">To illustrate how the code can be executed, the following example uses Ajax to request for a code, which will display the recipe from cake.txt file, which has HTML code in it.

                        <ol>
                          <li class="modal-p">Scalability: In traditional paradigm server has a greater load responding to incoming requests as well as executing the code. 
                            With CoD scalability can be improved since the client can take part of computational load and decreases the load of the server.
                             As a result, server can serve more clients at scale. </li>

                             <li class="modal-p">
                              Extensibility: Extensibility is adding new features or functionality to an existing application with ease. For example, if there is a need to add a new functionality which would display a button, an application that was developed with traditional approach would require re-installation or patching, which would be time-consuming. And if the client did not want the new functionality, it would be put in place but never be used. CoD overcomes these issues by providing flexibility for the user when to request the newly activated functionality. Unintended consequence of this would be better user perceived performance as the functionality codes are executed locally only when it is needed.
                              These were the main advantages. More details can be found in <a href="https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/papers/icse97.pdf">this paper</a>
